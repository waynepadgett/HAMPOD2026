1. Document Purpose and Scope

This document captures the formal requirements for the HAMPOD system, structured in a hierarchical manner suitable for verification and validation:

1. System-Level Requirements (SLR) - Define the overall system purpose, interfaces, and operational environment
2. High-Level Requirements (HLR) - Decompose SLRs into functional and non-functional requirements
3. Low-Level Requirements (LLR) - Specify implementation-level behaviors (to be documented separately)


1.1 Traceability Goals

Every requirement shall:
- Have a unique identifier
- Be traceable to a parent requirement (except SLRs)
- Be verifiable through test, analysis, inspection, or demonstration
- Be unambiguous and testable


1.2 Requirement Notation

Requirements use the following format:
```
[ID] The system SHALL/SHOULD/MAY <behavior> WHEN <condition>.
     Rationale: <why this requirement exists>
     Parent: <parent requirement ID>
     Verification: <Test  Analysis  Inspection  Demonstration>
```

Priority Keywords:
- SHALL = Mandatory requirement (must be implemented)
- SHOULD = Strongly desired (implement unless technically infeasible or cost-prohibitive)
- MAY = Optional/Nice-to-have (implement if resources permit)
