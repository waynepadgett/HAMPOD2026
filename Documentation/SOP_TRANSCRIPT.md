Me: Alright. Okay. We're going. We're live. Okay. So when I test the ampoule to make sure that it it has the right functionality and nothing is seriously broken. Generally, I want to restart it. So I know I'm starting it fresh, and it should with the radio on. And it should come up and say ready. Instead of radio not found. It actually speaks that. Mhmm. Okay. Yep. Do you you just wanna run through it for real? Sure. Is that that's the easiest way to make sure you don't miss anything? Okay. I can SSH into it pretty easily right here. I three? Yeah. Is it HAMPAD three? The pie three. Yeah. It's three. I thought it was all plugged in and ready to go. You just have to turn the radio on. No. I have to I brought the power supply. There we go. Okay. Alright. I'm into the m pod. It's on the Internet. It's happy. Did you restore it? No. What's the command for that? Just sudo restart now or something? I can't do it. What's the script called? Run input. And it restarts it? Okay. Run underscore hand pod, no caps. Run underscore handpod dot s h. Okay. See And do you have to run anything after that to get it to no. You can't just run that directly. You have to c d n to the director. Yeah. Yeah. Turn on the pi, the radio, and then run the script. I mean, SSH. Make sure the power supply is on. Let me have to go look at that and see. One sec. We're finished. That's the parasitoline? Okay. Have to do anything special to get run ham pod dot s h to run? Slash SageMon stuff. Let's send cleaned up some stuff and then said building firmware. And that's it. Then restart. I'm still s h 10. Come on. Still processes. Still height. Building firmware, software two. Nothing else? That's weird. Dude, try assescaging into the other one. Which will be a huge pain because I probably can't get into that either. Do one other thing for me first. Sure. Just do a pseudo restart. And just to sort of shut down. I heard that. Okay. I have to unplug the rear plug and end to get it back up. Possibly. Maybe it's reboot. One binky binky. Okay. Understand where the run's Hempod script doesn't work. I failed silently, so no one will ever nip. It failed silently, so we won't know. Unless we change it. To not fail silently. My go to would be to make a script that doesn't fail silently. There's See if I can get back in you. Yeah. I mean, Okay. Okay. To Mhmm. And that's great. Will tell you what status is. Okay. Should I run the run Hempod again? Set Oh, it's it's doing more than it was. It said perm Oh, yeah. There you go. Should be on. One second. Wait. Yeah. So it said ready. Mhmm. It said red. Right? So one thing to test is to spin the tuna knob and make sure that it's reads you the frequency. No water. And then I like to chest zero button. I hold it, Different said held zero. Right? That's right. There's no What does VFO stand for, and how do you spell it? VFO is variable frequency oscillator. And there's two of them. So it's VFO one or two. So, like, if you hit the enter key, it'll say frequency mode, and you can hit the enter key again. It should be change the VFO. And then to check to pull the different types of functions work. The four key is the only one that has three Functions. Mhmm. So if you press four, key, which Hold on. It's supposed to say a g c medium, for this radio. Because the radio hasn't automatic gain control. Level. Set to medium. Okay. That could be different. If the radio was set to some other level. Then it should read the radio. And what would an error look like? For this? Well, it could didn't say ADC in some level. Okay. Like I said, I want I want the four keys. Three different things. I want to press, Preamble. Just say preamp? Which says off. But it could be on. And then hold Could you see So that's pod, that, and it's just So does does that turn it on and off? Or does it It's only reporting. Unless you hit set. Okay. The star key at the top. So I need a note on shift. You'll have to explain that again. Which key is shift? Yes. Okay. The the top row has a a slash and a star. I've met the slash to So it looks like a slash on this keyboard. This keyboard is a slash. And that is the shift key. That is the shift key. That's all I need. But internally, the software thinks of it as a and b c a b c and d. Okay. Because on the original hand part, either are 16 keys. Well, thank you for for using Granola so much. You're gonna confuse Granola so much by telling it two different key mappings. It's gonna not know. Okay. No. Luckily I'm taking hand notes too. You completely googled that. Sorry. So you have the slap key. To shift. Okay. Right? The star key, So But the star key is also cancel. Okay. The the decimal key on this keypad is where this dark wood been. On the original handpuff phone. Mhmm. Oh my god. But he uses it for vestibule. So I use the decimal key. Right? So why did you say star earlier when you wanted to react to the frequency mode? Because the software labels it as STAR internally. Okay. And if I put keycaps on these, I would change them. To a b c d e and star. Right? Okay. So it's the period key on this. Yes. On this keypad is the is the decimal key. Yeah. If you hit the decimal key twice, that cancels your signal. So it's decimal or period. Or is there a difference? Well, it's a number. Keep keypad. So it's K. I mean, I don't think the Okay. You should pause it. Okay. Yeah. Alright. So across the top row, the star key is used for set. You have to hit set if you wanna test that it changes something. You hit set. It says set. And then I like to do hold nine. Power 45%. It said power 45%, which is what the radio is set to. And then I can enter I fifty five. Point. Point. And enter. Power set to fifty five. Now it's small. Power set to 55 and set off. So was able to change the power setting and confirm that. And then oh, you can turn the announcements on and off. And that's the minus key. I know it's insult. And then if you turn the tuning knob, it should not announce the frequency. So it didn't. That's good. Is that saved? If you restart it? No. But you can set a configuration setting. To turn announcements off, I think. We haven't implemented that function yet. Announcement song. So I just turn it back on. And the other thing I like to check is interrupts. Because if I make it read the frequency and then hit another key it should stop reading the frequency and do the other key. So I like to two and then four. So two will read the frequency. 14.2537. Preample. And I hit four while I was reading it, and it stopped and said preamp on. That's exactly the behavior I was looking looking for. If I do it faster, it should almost not even read the frequency. 14.25371 megahertz. A GC medium. Yeah. So I did sort of interrupt there. 14.25371 megahertz. AGC medium. That's actually a mistake. It shouldn't be his hat. But if I hit him if I hit the two and then the four before it even starts reading, it won't interrupt. It actually will queue it up. And read the frequency and then say AGC medium. But if I do it and then wait for it to start reading, it will interrupt. 14.253. Preampal. Alright. So it did interrupt there. But there's more delay there than there should be. I don't know. Thrilled about that. But I think that's it's better on the Pie Five than it is on the Pie Three. As far as that that delay to generate the the frequency text. Because that takes time to compute And that's pretty much it. Oh, I can do frequency mode. I can enter a frequency. Frequency mode. Seven. One. Two. Three. Four. 7.12345 megahertz. And you can see it got kind of confused there. But it worked. It set the radio, and then it announced the right frequency at the end. If I do it slow, you can hear what it sounds like. Frequency mode. One. Four. Point. Three. Six, nine. Eight. Seven. 14.36987 megahertz So there you go. That's pretty much it.
