Future Work ideas

Simulated Radio for hampod testing (Use an RPi maybe with a small display) to respond appropriatly to hamlib commands to allow testing without a real radio

Speech input system (microphone instead of keypad)

Testing with lower performance, lower cost RPi boards (RPi 3B?), reduced RAM

Investigate RPi speaker hat, microphone

A key for switching between devices (radio, antenna rotor, etc.)

Add support for many other radios (Icom, Kenwood, Yaesu, Elecraft, etc.)
