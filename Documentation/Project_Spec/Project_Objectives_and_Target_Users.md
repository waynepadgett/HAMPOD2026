# Project Objectives

- Develop a fully accessible, tactile‑first interface that empowers visually impaired amateur radio operators to control radios independently.
- Provide reliable, low‑latency frequency entry, band switching, and radio control via a USB keypad and audio cues.
- Support multiple radio models (e.g., ICOM IC‑7300, Kenwood TS‑570, TS‑2000) through a unified Hamlib‑based API.
- Ensure robust audio handling on Raspberry Pi platforms with automatic device prioritization and volume control.
- Maintain a modular, testable codebase that can be extended to new radio models or features without major re‑architecting.

# Target Users

- **Primary Users** – Visually impaired amateur radio operators who rely on tactile keypad input and audio feedback to operate radios independently.
- **Secondary Users** – Sighted radio enthusiasts, developers, and hobbyists who want a programmable, multi‑radio control solution.
- **Institutional Users** – Accessibility programs, educational institutions, and research projects focused on assistive technologies and adaptive radio interfaces.
